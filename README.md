# KNN
1. This is a practice of writing KNN algorithm to help myself really understand how this algorithm works.
2. The coding part is based on [lazy programmer](https://github.com/lazyprogrammer)
3. Since KNN is quite easy to understand, I think there's not much theories needed to be explained.
4. Although the background theories is not difficult, it doesn't mean that KNN is a bad algorithm, in some situations, it's pretty useful.
